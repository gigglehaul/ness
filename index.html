		"Hey, good evening, Frank. How’s the Farrell column going."

"Going pretty good today, Pipes. Just finished. I know it’s late, but I just felt like coming out for awhile. Say hello if you were working."

"Coming down here, 4th Street?"

Pipes’ smile showed he was kidding. Pipes and I were long time friends and his stomping grounds were his club on West 4th Street. We grew up, went to school and lived out our lives in these narrow streets of downtown. Known in song and story as 'the Lower East Side'. Until our lives took different paths. I went into the newspaper business and he got a little connected with the clubs.

"Yeah, where else am I going to find you, Pipes? And you always say the same thing. '4th Street?'"

The streets were narrow because they were old, and twisty and laid out in no pattern at all. That’s the way old New York City developed from the water’s edge between where the East River and the Hudson join. As it grew the wealth spread uptown and the new streets got more organized, they met and crossed at right angles, mostly.

But downtown stayed mixed up and over the years the neighborhoods kind of melted closer  together and shaped themselves into a curious little town within the city. Years ago, I don’t know exactly when, it became known as Greenwich Village. Even now, in 1962, with the Cold War still going on, and muscle cars tearing up the roads, and the new Corvettes making the scene, and rock and roll invading music, the Village kept its original neighborhood influences. A little mob, a little art, a lot of individualism and protest. West 4th Street was a little mob. Mostly mob backed clubs and pizza parlors and hotdog wagons at the curb with the original black cobblestones peeking through where the street blacktop was worn away. Pipes was part of the 'little mob' street.

"Well, it’s always good to see you, Frankie."

"What are you doing out here, Pipes? You’ll catch cold…..at least have a coat."

"Nah, I’m okay for a little."

He was the right guy to say ‘for a little’, because he was little. Short, that is. His natty black tuxedo made him look a bit thinner, but he was thick, short and thick...as in very strong. Like a fire plug. Pipes was a bit sensitive about his stature. He had started at the club as a bouncer and proved to be the best bouncer around. Not too much rough stuff after he became known, more the sheriff in town keeping order and civility. The owners liked that because ‘safe’ was a good way to attract tourist money  in exchange for their own darker shades of cash. So, they made him an owner, 10 percent, and he loved it. He loved the club atmosphere anyway and could display his singing pipes whenever he felt like. He had a mildly rough, warm way of expressing a song that folks liked. That’s where he got his name Pipes.

To me he was Angelo, but I called him Pipes, too, because he took some pride in that.

He was standing at the door to the club under the red awning that ran down to the curb. The edges of the awning were twisted with silver tinsel all the way to the street. A touch of tasteful seasoning, not gaudy. He watched me glance at the mild glitter.

"Just a little, Frank. What do you think?"

"Looks nice, Pipes. It’s the season." I met him with his warm familiar handshake.

"You got anyone nice for the season, newsboy,…..this year?"

"No, been too busy to look much. Seen some beauties, but haven’t tried."                                                                                                                                            

"Verna is here again, Frank. You know, I think I’m in love with her."

"Think? Anyone who knows you….even a little….can see that."

"No, I don’t show stuff like that."

"Well, anyone that listens when you sing together."

"I just sit in to play the piano for her."

"And sing, Pipes. You play and sing. The two of you are like cream and sugar."

"Naw, get out of here."

"You can't kid an old kidder, Pipes. We know each other, remember?"

He pulled open the door and motioned for me to go in. Vito, the car catcher, was just handing a stub to a shiny new 1962 Buick Riviera and his over-dressed date. Buicks, even a Riviera, didn’t quite make the classy cut. "Come on in. You’re full of crap, Frank. I got a nice little table for you. I got a number to do with Verna. It’s not love. I’ll even buy you a drink, the first one."

"I’m not full of crap, Pipes."

"You want that drink? Then, be quiet" And he was gone, but I still didn’t believe him. I could tell by the way he looked at her when they said a few words before the song. By the way he sang, low key, letting her have the lead. I took a sip of my drink and, then, noticed that Verna was singing to Pipes. The two of them together in their own little world. To hell with the customers, but I’d say the customers got a bargain, a touching performance they weren’t even aware of. But I was. When the set ended, Pipes came to my table and sat down. He propped his chin in his hand and shook his head. "You know, Frank, I have to admit it, I do love Verna. And I only know her a couple of years."

"That’s long enough, Pipes. You sounded good tonight.....together."                                                                                                                                      

"But what if she doesn’t love me. All those 4th Street guys after her."

"What 4th Street guys?"

"You know who I mean, the big shots around here."

A waiter came to the table. "Pipes, there’s a guy over there that’s trouble."

"Okay, Scotty, I hear him."

"Can you…?"

"I’ll be right there, Scotty. I know him. I’ll take care of it."

Scotty still looked worried. "It’s the cop."

"I know who it is. Go."

"Whose the cop, Pipes?"
